==========================================================================================================================================

Software Engineer
--------------------------

I've been learning to code for the past few years after switching from IT Support Engineer for a couple of years but I have really found my passion in coding and developing and gained experience JavaScript, React, HTML/CSS , React, Redux, Java and Ruby, 
Next, I worked on a web application project for booking rooms where technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JSP for frontend and Java for backend have been used. Next, on the localhost, I have used the XAMP server, where the MYSQL database server has been used.  -->
